# Dual

Dual is a gem that helps you clone object in Ruby. It is not tight to any particular
web framework and should work with ease with any PORO.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dual'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dual

## Usage
```ruby
class Order
  attr_accessor :name, :type, :address

  include Dual

  dual do
    # Exclude a certain attribute from the cloned object
    exclude :type

    # Include a new attribute in the cloned object
    include :email, value: 'test@test.com'

    # Add a guard clause for both include and exclude statements
    include :date, value: Date.today, if: :delivery_incoming?
    
    # Perform any kind of finalizing actions on the created object
    # The callable object(any object that responds to `call`) receives
    # the dual object
    finalize -> (copied_order) { EventNotifier.call(copied_order) }
  end

  def delivery_incoming?
    delivery.today?
  end
end

order = Order.last
dual_order = order.dual_copy
```

If you are using `Sequel` you can also use dual to manipulate associations, supported ones are:
`one_to_one`, `one_to_many`, `many_to_one`

```ruby
  class User < Sequel::Model
    one_to_many :orders
    include Dual

    dual do
      add_association :orders
    end
  end
```
This will create association objects that do not point to the original associations. A simple example would be:
```ruby
user = User.create
order = Order.create(address: 'some street')
user.add_order(order)

# Duplicate the user, along with the orders association
dupped_user = user.dual_copy
dupped_order = dupped_user.orders.first
# Change the order address
dupped_order.address = 'new street'

order.address == dupped_order.address
=> false
```

You can also remove certain associations:
```ruby
  dual do
    remove_association :orders
  end
```
```ruby
user = User.create
order = Order.create(address: 'some street')
user.add_order(order)

# Duplicate the user, excluding the orders association
dupped_user = user.dual_copy
dupped_user.orders
=> []
```
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

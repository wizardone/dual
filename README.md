# Dual

Dual is a gem that helps you clone object in Ruby. It is not tight to any particular
web framework and should work with ease with any PORO.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dual'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dual

## Usage
class Order
```ruby
  attr_accessor :name, :type, :address

  include Dual

  dual do
    # Exclude a certain attribute from the cloned object
    exclude :type

    # Include a new attribute in the cloned object
    include :email, value: 'test@test.com'

    # Add a guard clause for both include and exclude statements
    include :date, value: Date.today, if: :delivery_incoming?
    
    # Perform any kind of finalizing actions on the created object
    # The callable object(any object that responds to `call`) receives
    # the dual object
    finalize -> (copied_order) { EventNotifier.call(copied_order) }
  end

  def delivery_incoming?
    delivery.today?
  end
end

order = Order.last
dual_order = order.dual_copy
```

If you are using sequel you can also use dual to manipulate associations:

```ruby
  class Order < Sequel::Model
    many_to_one :user
    include Dual

    dual do
      add_association :user
    end
  end
```

In this way you will end up having a new users collection loaded for the cloned object:

```ruby
order = Order.create
order.user = User.create(email: 'test@test.com')

User.count
=> 1
cloned_order = order.dual_copy
User.count
=> 2
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

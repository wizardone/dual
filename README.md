web framework and should work with ease with any PORO.

## Installation

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage
class Order
  attr_accessor :name, :type, :address

  include Dual

  dual do
    # Exclude a certain attribute from the cloned object
    exclude :type
    # Include a new attribute in the cloned object
    include :email, value: 'test@test.com'
    # Add a guard clause for both include and exclude statements
    include :date, value: Date.today, if: :delivery_incoming?
  end

  def delivery_incoming?
    delivery.today?
  end
end

order = Order.last
dual_order = order.dual_copy
